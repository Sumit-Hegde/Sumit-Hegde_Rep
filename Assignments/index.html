	<center><h1>Phases in an Assignment</h1></center>
<section1 id="Section1">Assigning</section1>
<p>This the first phase in the process of assignments. The topics discussed are given in terms of questions to test the awareness and the extent to which a student has understood and realized the topics. The question should include all the major topics and some minor topics to truly test what the person has understood.</p>
<section2 id="Section2">Completing</section2>
<p>This is the phase where the student analyzes the problem statement and works toward producing the necessary solution for the problem by implementing all that they have learnt in the course. Efficiency is important to create a good impression in the teacher's mind that the concepts being taught are reaching the student well. This improves the whole teaching-learning experience.</p>
<section3 id="Section3">Submitting</section3>
<p>This is the final phase. This basically involves the student communicating with their teacher a solutioion they came up with to the problem statement proposed by the teacher. This stage shows to the teacher how much the student is able to get a hold of in the course and allows the teacher to adapt his style according to the level of understanding shown by the student.</p>
